# ASAP : Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline

Here are the source codes used on the server to run the different tools available on <a href="https://asap-beta.epfl.ch">ASAP</a>.
Currently, this code is running on the BETA version of ASAP, but the original website is still accessible <a href="https://asap.epfl.ch">here</a>.

Mostly, this is composed of:
- R & Python scripts (for most of the tools)
- Java code (for handling the Loom files, generating the JSON, handling the fast-no-RAM computations)
- [Ruby-On-Rails Server code & Docker files](https://github.com/fabdavid/asap2_web)
